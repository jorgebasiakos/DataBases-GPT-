I created this project using ChatGPT 3.5. All (random) records are organized into blocks and should be sorted at the end. 
This method is particularly effective when dealing with large databases that exceed the capacity of RAM. 
The records are initially divided into chunks, with each chunk containing sorted records. 
Subsequently, these sorted chunks are merged. 
This algorithm is particularly useful in SQL queries when sorting results using the ORDER BY clause.
